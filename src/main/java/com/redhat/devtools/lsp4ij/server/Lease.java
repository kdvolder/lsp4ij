     * The result of applying the function is not cached, instead each time the lease's
     * {@code get()} method is called the function will be called again.
     * <p>
     * The returned lease doesn't create a new claim on the language server's lifetime but
     * rather shares the same claim as the original lease. Thus disposing either the
     * original or transformed lease will implicitly dispose both of them at the same time.

     * A typical use of this method might be to access the languageserver associated with
     * the lease and cast it to a more specific type. For example:
     * <pre>{@code
     *     Lease<MyLanguageServer> serverLease = serverItem
     *          .keepAlive()
     *          .transform(si -> (MyCustomLanguageServer)si.getServer());
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @return A Lease that shares the same liveness claim as the original lease.
